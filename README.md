Machine Learning Projects with the use of the Perceptron Algorithm

Uploaded are the files used in a course in college. 

Images-
The images used are not going to be in the correct places upon installing everything, the main jupyter notebook file (which is what I used to create this) looked into an images folder where I kept all the images and called to that location.

There is a zip file of the entire folder which has everything in it's proper places and order. Feel free to use and tinker with this.
